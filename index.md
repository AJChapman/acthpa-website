The ACT Hang gliding and Paragliding Association (ACTHPA) is the club
for all hang gliders, paragliders and their motorised forms in the
region. The region is excellent for carbon-free flying and there are
some great areas for motorised flight as well. We have many excellent
sites, local paragliding instructors and an active pilot community. We
maintain a number of launch sites, and wind talkers in the local area to
help in deciding when and where to fly.

Club meetings are held on the first Tuesday of each month at
[the Canberra Labor Club](http://www.laborclub.com.au) in Weston
Creek starting at 7.30 pm. At the meetings we talk about flying and put
members in contact with each other. We have a strong social scene.

If it is 'on' then you can pretty much guarantee that someone will be
out flying. If you are planning to go for a fly at one of the sites
listed on the "Flying Canberra" tab of the website, please tag a message
on Twitter [@ACTHPA](http://twitter.com/ACTHPA/) so you can meet up with
others. The wind talker provides current wind speed and direction and
records this information for the previous 12 hours.  The weather section
links to the Bureau of Meteorology and other useful weather information.

If you are a visiting pilot, remember to contact one of the locals prior
to flying any site.

There are schools to learn Paragliding and Hang gliding both close by and interstate.
Given the usual training for both types of sport take around 7-10 days for a full course, many people travel interstate to a school, making a holiday of it.
If you are keen to learn to fly, you are very welcome to our month club meetings held on the first Tuesday of the month at 7:30pm at the [Canberra Labor
Club](http://www.laborclub.com.au/weston-creek-labor-club/) in Weston Creek.
We will be down the far end in the meeting room on right near the food area.
Stop by, introduce yourself and have a chat. 

For a full list of schools please visit the [HGFA Schools](http://www.hgfa.asn.au/Schools/schools.php) web page.

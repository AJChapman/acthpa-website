Nicolas Siefken has been flying paragliders and has been a member of the ACTHPA since 2003.
During this time, Nick has been involved in various aspects of club life.
Nick has served on the Executive Committee at different times in different roles.

Nick was a Safety Officer from 2007 and assisted Senior Safety Officers with endorsement clinics during that time.
Nick has contributed many hours of supervision and mentorship at our sites around Canberra as a duty pilot, providing novice pilots with guidance and support to fly in their early days, many times resulting in him not getting the opportunity to fly himself.

Nick has also contributed at working bees, and assisting with general bits and pieces whenever asked.

Nick has retired from flying in the last 18 months however the committee wishes to acknowledge his considerable contribution with a Life Membership.

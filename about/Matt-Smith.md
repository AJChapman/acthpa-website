Matt has been flying since January 2008 and has been associated with the ACTHPA since that time.
He has been involved in various aspects of club life during that time.
Matt has served on the Executive Committee in multiple roles, commencing as a site officer, then as Association President and finally as the Public Officer for a number of years.

Matt has been a Safety Officer since 2009 and then a Senior Safety Officer for both paragliding and powered paragliding disciplines since 2013.
In this role, Matt has run numerous endorsements and clinics to assist local pilots with advancing through experience levels and attaining necessary qualifications.
Matt has also contributed many hours of supervision and mentorship at our sites around Canberra as a duty pilot, providing novice pilots with guidance and support to fly in their early days, many times resulting in him not getting the opportunity to fly himself.

Matt has also contributed at working bees, and assisting with general bits and pieces whenever asked.

Matt became the ACT representative to the HGFA in 2015 and later the HGFA President following the passing of the previous president.
Matt handed over the HGFA President role in early 2016 due to escalating work commitments overseas however has remained the ACT representative during 2017.

In 2012, together with Barry Oliver, Matt assisted with the development of the Oxygen Endorsement syllabus and again in 2016 he was instrumental in the development of the PPG Cross Country syllabus.

The committee wishes to acknowledge his considerable contribution with a Life Membership.

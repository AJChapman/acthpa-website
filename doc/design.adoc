=== Advice for Pilots

Some general advice for pilots in the region.
The sort of thing you would eventually learn through talking to others at a meeting.

==== Flying Safely

. Understand the weather,
. Talk to local pilots,
. (PG) Don't fly a wing that is too advanced for your skill and experience level,
. (PG) Do SIV training,
. (PG) When ridge soaring, test your penetration.
. (PG) When ridge soaring, don't fly too close to the hill.

==== Weather Hazards

==== Comms

. Post on and check Facebook,
. Use channel HGFA 1 (frequency xxx, tone squelch yyy),
. Track some XC pilots of highcloud.net (link).

==== Flying the Lake

. Look at the wind talker,
. Hang gliders fly the sea breeze at the lake in the evening,
. Paragliders fly the sea breeze at the lake early the next morning,
. Collector is generally for XC,
. Geary's Gap is a good place to learn to top land, but don't learn in strong winds.

==== Flying XC

. XC from Spring Hill is hard because of airspace, but possible,
. Our best XC site is Collector, though it only works in a light prevailing easterly, and airspace is still a concern. 
. Honeysuckle and Binalong are possible XC sites if you are willing to travel further,

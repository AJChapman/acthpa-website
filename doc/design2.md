# A New Site Design

The [old design](design.adoc) was getting a bit out of hand, and I've had other thoughts since.
This is a fresh take.

## Design Principles

1. Keep the structure simple.

Most people aren't going to go delving too far into the site.
They want to find what they're looking for pretty quickly, i.e. in at most one click.

2. Make the most important stuff the easiest to find.

List out what is most important, then design accordingly.

## What is Important?

- Current flying status information
- News (including latest flights)
- Upcoming events
- Information for visiting pilots
- Information for local pilots
- Past events (including previous flights)
- Information for prospective pilots
- Information for land owners
- Human interest stories
- Advice
- FAQs
- Media info
- About Us info

## Site Structure

Anything marked with an '@' symbol should be its own page

- @Home
    - Next upcoming event
    - Next big upcoming event
    - Latest news item
    - Latest big news item
    - Prominent links to info (sites, visiting pilot info, FAQ)
    - Prominent link to Facebook group
    - A randomly selected story (weighted perhaps?)
- @Now (Dashboard?)
    - Wind Talkers
    - Dashboard
    - Spot tracker?
- @Future (upcoming events?)
    - Club meeting
    - Club trip
    - National competition
    - International competition

    - Recent flights table (or turn recent flights into news items???)

    - Quick list of sites, with links

## Site Structure that I Can Do Now

The above is where I want to get to, but at the moment I only have (or can easily create) content for the following pared-down structure:

- @Home
    - Next upcoming event
    - Latest news item
    - Prominent links to info (sites, visiting pilot info, FAQ)
    - Prominent link to Facebook group
    - A randomly selected story (weighted perhaps?)
- @Now 
    - Wind Talkers
    - Current events
- @Future (upcoming events?)
    - Club meeting
    - National competition
    - International competition
- @Past (News?)
    - News items
        - E.g. Kari 3rd in World Championships
    - Recent flights table (or turn recent flights into news items???)
    - Flight records 
- @Info
    - Radio frequency
    - Quick list of sites, with links
    - Visiting Pilots
    - @Sites
    - @FAQ
    - @About ACTHPA
        - Life members
        - About us and contact info

That's actually not too far from what we want!

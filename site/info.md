## Visiting Pilots

Visiting pilots are always very welcome at any of our sites.
We only ask that you adhere to these common sense rules:

- Be a current member of [SAFA] (formerly HGFA). International pilots must hold a [SAFA Visiting Pilot Membership (VPM)].
- Familiarise yourself with the [site guide](http://acthpa.localhost/info/sites/) of the site you are flying.
- Make yourself known to a site safety officer and obtain a site briefing (if possible).
- Fly with a UHF radio (see Communication, below).

The best way to get in touch with local pilots is through [our Facebook group].

## Flying Canberra

All the flying sites in Canberra are approximately 30-45 minutes drive from the city centre. This makes Canberra a very accessible paragliding and hang gliding area.

All the sites have various restrictions either for accessing launch, landing areas and/or airspace.
Many have locked gates, require approval from landholders or have unique issues that all pilots need to be aware of before accessing either the launch or the landing areas.
In addition, the sites have safety hazards including power lines, rotor and nasty thermic conditions.
Respect for these sites extends from pilot safety to landholder and land use issues.
However, this should not detract from any qualified pilot having some great flights from Canberra. 

If car-pooling, club protocol is to offer the driver $5 per lift up the hill to cover fuel and vehicle wear and tear.
It is at the vehicles owner's discretion as to whether they accept payment.

### Airspace

The Canberra region has great sites located close to the city, but unfortunately this means that we fly close to controlled airspace.
Make sure that before flying anywhere in the region you familiarise yourself with the airspace restrictions.
The best way to do this is to look at the Canberra region in [AirCheck](http://xcaustralia.org/aircheck/aircheck.php), but the [Now page](/now) also gives a visual overview.

The penalties for flying in controlled airspace without authorisation are harsh and jeopardise flying activities for others.

### Communication

UHF radios are used for communication between pilots and others such as ground crew and landholders.
The [HGFA Channel (472.125 Mhz open)](http://www.safa.asn.au/resources/HGFA_UHF_Radio_Channel.pdf) is the main communication channel used by paragliding pilots, while hang glider pilots are using Channel 14 CTCSS 71.9.

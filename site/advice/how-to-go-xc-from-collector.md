title: "How to go XC from Collector"

Collector is an excellent cross-country site, even for beginners.
It's used as a PG1 training hill, and XC to Murrumbateman as a PG2 on a low B is possible.
It's also arguably the best Canberra site for going big distances.
Collector does have a few challenges that can make it hard to get away though, so this article will explain what these are and how to surmount them.

The following is based on my experiences as a beginner and intermediate paraglider pilot flying these routes from Collector, mostly on a Mentor 4 (a high-B wing):

- 42km west to Murrumbateman (on a Swing Arcus, a low EN-B wing),
- [88km north-west to Boorowa](https://www.xcontest.org/2019/world/en/flights/detail:alex.chapman/23.12.2018/00:27)
- [40km north-west to Jerrawa](https://www.xcontest.org/2019/world/en/flights/detail:alex.chapman/28.10.2018/01:25)
- A short hop to Gundaroo,
- [40km east to Tarago](https://www.xcontest.org/world/en/flights/detail:alex.chapman/28.10.2019/02:30)
- [188km west then south-west to Tarcutta](https://www.xcontest.org/world/en/flights/detail:alex.chapman/19.1.2020/01:45)

TODO: put in a table of recent/longest flights from Collector (notable flights maybe?)

Let's take a look at those challenges and how we can work around them.

The main challenges are:

- Getting up,
- getting back up the hill after bombing out,
- staying under airspace, 6,500ft (1981m) over launch, with lower airspace nearby,
- avoiding the power line hazards,
- not ending up in tiger country.

On some days we may have additional challenges:

- Overzealous eagles,
- wind-blown thermals,
- the swamp.

## Getting Up

The first challenge at Collector is getting up.
There are two scenarios here: when there is enough wind to ridge soar, and when there isn't.

When there's enough wind to ridge soar then it isn't so bad.
You cruise back and forth, taking thermals when they come to you.
The hard part is once you catch a thermal, it will drift over the back.
To stay in the thermal you have to drift with it, so as you get higher you will get further back behind the ridge.
It won't be long before getting back to the ridge into the headwind will cease to be an option.
So at some point you have to decide whether to commit to this thermal or head back to the ridge.
This decision is made harder when you look at the country behind the ridge.
There are an awful lot of trees down there!
But it isn't actually as bad as it looks, for two reasons.
First, there are actually plenty of gaps in the trees if you look for them.
Second, the thermals always seem to consolidate behind the ridge, especially as you get higher.
So it won't be long before staying up ceases to be a problem, and staying below airspace starts to be one.

The other scenario is a day with very little wind.
Here the challenge is finding a thermal before you lose all your height.
This is pretty much up to luck.
You have several options.
The first decision is whether to go right, straight, or left.
If you've chosen  to go right, 

## TODO
A little secret: it's easier to go XC down wind than it is to stay at launch!

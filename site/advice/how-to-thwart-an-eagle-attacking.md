Cav Man had a piercing  
Not an earlobe or his nose  
An eagle hit him as he flew  
Where the highway northwards flows

Then Joel took a hit as well  
It made him rather edgy  
To hear that high pitched scream  
Of an angry swooping wedgy

The day before Dave Hanna   
Found his situation hectic  
But in true Dave Hanna manne   
He just pulled an asymmetri

So I'd argue that Pete's penguin  
Remains a topic of debate  
As a team of Lake George eagles  
Has been active as of late

It was Cav Man asked the question  
Has this been tried before ?  
And Peter duly answered yes  
By my hang gliding friend Igor

He doesn't use a penguin  
But hopes the birds will sicken  
From chewing on the leg  
Of his great big rubber chicken

Although Peter keeps insisting  
The penguin's doing fine  
It sometimes gets entangled  
As he's hauling in the line

His one and only small concern  
Is that a penguin is pass√©  
As the eagle took no notice  
When he flew the other day

So Peter's in negotiation  
With the household cat  
Out of work, on benefits  
And slowly getting fat

He will make the cat a harness,  
Use a bungee, not a string  
So pussy gets to bounce around  
To oscillate and swing

Pete says he's taken full account  
Of the RSPCA  
The cat will have a contract  
With the lure of double pay

It's chicken hearts if he survives  
So he has no need to scrounge  
Bowls of lovely clotted cream  
And a cushion on the lounge

It seems to me a decent deal  
To be a decoy for an eagle  
And the terms and the conditions  
Might be marginally legal

Soon such creative innovations  
These forms of avian distraction  
Could engage a lot of pilots  
And become a main attraction

There be penguins, rubber chickens  
And perhaps the household cat  
Barbie dolls and spotted dogs  
And other things like that

I can see a team out flying  
With brightly coloured toys  
And on the count of one two three  
We'd deploy all our decoys

What self respecting eagle  
Would want to stay around  
And attack a fleet of flyers  
As they sped above the ground

So it's thanks to Peter Withell  
This problem might be sorted  
And the eagles flying at the lake  
Might finally be thwarted

But the group has many talents  
There's no question we're eclectic  
We should also test the theory  
Of the Hanna asymmetric

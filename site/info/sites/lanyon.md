The Lanyon site overlooks Canberra's most southern suburb.
It is west-facing, and its valley location means that it can sometimes be flyable when other sites are blown out.
It holds potential for XC, but like Spring Hill it starts out with a 4,500ft airspace ceiling, so getting away can be challenging.

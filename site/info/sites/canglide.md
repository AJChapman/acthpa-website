This site is suitable for all SAFA pilots and is able to be used by
anyone who would like to experience what paragliding is like, whether
they be friends or family. The many virtual reality (VR) sites available
to choose from take winds from all directions. Landing zones vary from
target spot landings to out-landings in the mountains, valleys or plains
depending on your chosen scenario.

## Launches

Flight simulations start at a point after launch, either close by for
thermic flights, or near landing areas in simulations which focus on
spot landing accuracy or out-landing decision making. Some simulations
are dune or ridge soaring and these commence at points shortly after
take-off or in an established soaring pattern for which the pilot must
master clean and efficient turns to remain aloft or else find a safe top
or bottom landing.

## Access

Vehicular access is available with good parking options at the site. The
address is 4 Montford Cres, Lyneham. The paragliding simulator is
located at the premises of Jet Flight Simulator Canberra (JFSC).

## Who and what is CanGlide

Four local pilots, Alex Boiko, Paul Shipley (Shippers), Michael
Claringbould and Nick Lemon have set up CanGlide to facilitate the
operation of probably the most capable and realistic paragliding
simulator available today. Around 150,000 Euro was spent on its
development in the Netherlands by [Flightcoach](https://flightcoach.nl/paragliding-vrsimulator-training/). Alex, Shippers, Michael
and Nick have put in their own money to set CanGlide up however they are
not receiving any financial benefit themselves. All money raised from
selling flights is directed toward paying Flightcoach's monthly licence
fee and other minor administration costs. Check out the [CanGlide website](http://www.canglide.com.au) for more details.

## Booking

Booking is essential but easy to arrange. Either use the form on
[CanGlide's website](http://www.canglide.com.au) or send an email to
<info@CanGlide.com.au> with your details and your preferred date and
time. One of the CanGlide operators will get in touch and set up an
appointment for you.

## Hazards

Everyone who has tried the simulator has found it exceeded their
expectations, so be prepared for a desire to want more flights!

## Landowners

The landowner is Trevor, who runs Jet Flight Simulator Canberra.
Trevor allows the simulator to be located at the premises where there is a 737 jet simulator and two Icaros weight-shift VR simulators.
Trevor sells PG simulator flights to his customers, and this covers the equivalent of CanGlideâ€™s rent.
However, if you want the benefit of an experienced paragliding pilot to operate the simulator be sure to book through CanGlide.

title: ACTHPA Biosecurity Declaration Collector
---

[In May 2022, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) was reported in cattle in Indonesia including Bali](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity-trade/pests-diseases-weeds/animal/fmd).

Australia has strong biosecurity laws which farmers and graziers must implement to protect agricultural industries.

The landholder/manager of the Collector bombout has requested that we as a club implement the following new actions when using this site:

- Under no circumstances can anyone enter any part of this site (launch orr bombout areas) if they have travelled to Indonesia, including Bali, in the last 3 months.
- Persons must record their name, the time and the date they enter the site (by submitting this form).
- ACTHPA locks are not to be used on this site at the moment. Different locks are required to ensure access is tightly controlled.

ACTHPA committee members are in close contact with the landowner/manager regarding these requirements which may change without notice.

Please answer all of the following questions:

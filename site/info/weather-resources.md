The [Wind Talkers] show the current conditions and trends at our most commonly used local sites.
The links below are to websites used by numerous pilots to access local weather conditions:

* [Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)]
* [Weatherzone] - [iPhone App][Weatherzone iPhone App] / [Android App][Weatherzone Android App]
* [WillyWeather] - [iPhone App][WillyWeather iPhone App] / [Android App][WillyWeather Android App]
* [XC Skies] 
* [RASP] - [iPhone App][RASP iPhone App]
* [SkySight]
* [Oz Forecast]
* [Sea Breeze] - [iPhone App][Sea Breeze iPhone App]

The BOM's website is great for looking at synoptic charts, Canberra
Observations (surrounding weather stations), MetEye (wind trends) and
the obvious rain radar.

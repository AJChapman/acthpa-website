Spring Hill is a west-facing soaring and thermic site just 20 minutes from the centre of Canberra.
It is a versatile site, with possible flights ranging from short hops on the beginner slopes through to sleddies from the top when it's light, hours of spacious soaring when it's stronger, transitioning to thermalling when the day heats up.
It's even possible to go XC, though getting away is made more challenging by the low 4,500ft airspace.
A classic Spring Hill experience is to watch the sun set during an evening glass-off, where the wind turns buttery smooth, and the lift band extends for hundreds of metres out the front of the hill.

Lake George is Canberra's 'coastal' site.
We soar the 20km+ ridge on the western side of the lake in an easterly breeze, cruising above the Federal Highway.
We usually launch at the southern end of the ridge, which we refer to as 'the lake', 'geary's gap', or the 'south launch'.
This allows easy launching and top landing, and a huge lake-sized landing paddock.
But airspace is at only 3,500ft here, so to go XC we fly to the northern end of the ridge, or start at the Collector launch.
The lake is also an ideal place for powered paraglider and weight-shift microlight flying.

For information on flying Lake George, check out the **[Lake George site guide](https://siteguide.org.au/Sites/Lake%20George%20(South%20Launch).html)**.

## Lanyon

<div class="grid-item">![](/images/lanyon-view-from-airspace.jpg)</div>
</div>

The Lanyon site overlooks Canberra's most southern suburb.
It is west-facing, and its valley location means that it can sometimes be flyable when other sites are blown out.
It holds potential for XC, but like Spring Hill it starts out with a 4,500ft airspace ceiling, so getting away can be challenging.

For information on flying at Lanyon, check out the **[Lanyon site guide](https://siteguide.org.au/Sites/Lanyon.html)**.

Collector is a launch at the northern end of Lake George.
It takes an easterly, and can be soarable, but it is primarily a thermic site.
It has a higher airspace ceiling than other sites close to the ACT, at 6,500ft, which makes it good for cross-country.

For information on flying from Collector, check out the **[Collector site guide](https://siteguide.org.au/Sites/Lake%20George%20(Collector).html)**.

Geary's gap is just across the highway from the south launch, but is currently closed. For more information see the  **[Lake George (Geary's Gap) site guide](https://siteguide.org.au/Sites/Lake%20George%20(Geary's%20Gap).html)**.

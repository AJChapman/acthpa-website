The Australian Capital Territory Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association (ACTHPA) is an incorporated body in the ACT.
It is both a State Association affiliated with the Sports Aviation Federation of Australia (SAFA, formerly HGFA), and the primary club for free flying in the Canberra region.
[Here are the ACTHPA Objects and Rules as of 4 October 2020](/files/ACTHPA Objects and Rules - 4 Oct 2022.pdf).

## ACT SAFA Regional Development Levy

The ACTHPA is affiliated with SAFA as the regional association for the ACT and surrounding area.
Members of SAFA who live in the postcodes described in the SAFA Policy on Regional Boundaries pay a Regional Development Levy (RDL) as part of their annual SAFA membership fee.
The RDL is disbursed to the ACTHPA and is used to progress the initiatives outlined in ACTHPA annual plans.
This includes promoting safety, improving flying site infrastructure including weather stations, supporting regional flying events, and ACTHPA administration.

Members of the ACTHPA with ideas to improve safety, infrastructure, events or administration are encouraged to reach out to the ACTHPA committee with suggestions.
Monthly meetings are well attended and are a great place to discuss ideas with other members.
The ACTHPA committee may ask that proposals be outlined in writing for further consideration.

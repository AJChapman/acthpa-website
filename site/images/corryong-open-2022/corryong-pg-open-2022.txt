The last task had us racing up and down the Corryong valley under some nice big clouds.

Probably a pre-start gaggle. Dan Thuillier just left of center, Kari Ellis towards the top right.

I think this was during the last task, near the start. I'd rather be with the gaggle in the top left.

That's Corryong ahead, a nice big cloud marking the way. Probably the first glide after the start of a task.

This one's just pretty. Mt. Mittamatite in the background. Looks like I'm in a good spot.

Yeesh, we're a bit low here, before the start of a task.

Kari on the right. Could be Al Dickie right of center.

Kari bottom center. Gareth Carter top right. Maybe Grum bottom left.

It's always a relief to have made this crossing.

A mid-race gaggle.

Cute, isn't it. Looks like Kari's wing at the back.

## Sports Aviation Operations Suspended in the ACT Region

It is with great regret that the ACT Hang Gliding and Paragliding
Association announces that flying operations are suspended in the ACT
Region from midnight on 30 Mar 2020. There has been debate in our
community about the moral and social impacts of flying during the
coronavirus crisis and some individuals have chosen not to fly. However
that is no longer relevant as we are now of the opinion that flying
operations in our region would be unlawful.

On the evening of 29 Mar 2020 the Prime Minister announced measures to
protect the community. NSW effected that through a Public Health Order
which came into force from midnight on 30 Mar 2020, and the ACT is
expected to follow suit with a similar Public Health Directive. The [NSW
Public Health (COVID-19 Restrictions on Gathering and Movement) Order
2020](https://preview.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/public-health-orders)
describes two prohibitions that are inconsistent with our operations.

In particular, the Order directs that a person must not leave their
place of residence without a reasonable excuse. We do not believe that
flying operations would be viewed as a reasonable excuse. Some have
considered that our operations, such as hike and fly, might be
considered exercise and therefore be interpreted to mean a reasonable
excuse. While hiking might be, flying is not and we urge all pilots to
avoid trying to interpret the Order in a way which might suit their
desires but is counter to the intent.

Of equal concern is that the Order directs the closure of certain
premises. Our flying sites meet the definition of 'community
facilities'. Flying from our sites would constitute operating the
premises by land owners, our association (through our agreements with
the land owners), and the pilots flying from them. This would expose all
of us and as the flying would be unlawful and our insurances would be
void, further voiding our agreements with land owners which require that
we are insured.

We understand that this suspension will deeply affect those of us who
are addicted to flying. Once this virus storm has passed we are all
looking forward to resuming operations.

Notes:

-   Flying operations includes paragliding, hang gliding, powered
    paragliding, and powered hang gliding.

-   The ACT Region means the same thing as described in the SAFA Policy
    on Region Boundaries. The geographic extent is defined by postcodes
    and includes all of the ACT and NSW Postcodes in the areas
    surrounding the ACT (2580-2582, 2618-2621). This includes our sites
    in NSW such Collector, Lake George, Spring Hill, and Pig Hill. We
    are of the view that the Lanyon site should be closed as well.

## About ACTHPA

The [ACT Hang gliding and Paragliding Association (ACTHPA)](info/about) is the club for all hang gliders, paragliders and their motorised forms in the region.
The region is excellent for carbon-free flying and there are some great areas for motorised flight as well.
We have [many excellent sites](info/sites), local paragliding instructors and an active pilot community.
We maintain a number of launch sites, and [wind talkers] in the local area to help in deciding when and where to fly.

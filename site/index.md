## Current COVID-19 Policy (updated 7 April 2020)

The ACTHPA committee has [updated our policy on flying operations](/files/2020-04-07-COVID-19-Update.pdf).
Consequently the current policy is:

### Lanyon (and Other Flying in the ACT)

- The ACT Government has provided [advice that flying is not currently unlawful](/files/2020-04-06-ACT-Sport-Rec-Advice.pdf).
  This includes further advice about social distancing.
  Their advice may change, you should monitor the [ACT Government website](https://www.covid19.act.gov.au/) for any park closures or other restrictions.
- Access to State and National Parks (where Lanyon is located) is a
  matter for the ACT Government and/or Federal Governments, should
  they close the Parks this will close the site.

### All ACTHPA Sites Located in NSW

- Suspension of sites access remains in place currently; we are awaiting advice from NSW Sports and Rec that flying activities are not unlawful under the blanket provisions.
  When this is received this will be distributed.
- NSWHPA has engaged with NSW Sports and Recreation, any advice received by ACTHPA will be provided to members as soon as practicable.
- Landholder access is a separate issue, we will advise members if access is withdrawn by landholders.
  The ACTHPA Committee will engage with landholders once guidance is received from the NSW Government to confirm access arrangements.

### Other Matters

- Tandems are not currently approved by SAFA (email of 30 March 2020 to all SAFA members).
- ACTHPA Members are advised to read, follow and stay updated with the social distancing rules and other restrictions in force [in the ACT](http://covid19.act.gov.au/) and [NSW](https://nsw.gov.au/covid-19).
- The organising of public gatherings remains prohibited by Government (this includes organising to fly on Facebook, via messenger or any other means).
- As per SAFA advice, you should fly even more cautiously than normal and take no unnecessary risks.

### ACTHPA Committee Advice

In our context and following the above we provide the following advice:

- The number of people on the site should be limited.
  If you turn up to a site and it is not possible to maintain an adequate distance
from others at all times, then you should leave.
- Do not share cars, or give other pilots a lift, other than with members of your household.
- Cross country flights should not occur, people should land in the designated landing zones. This is particularly important where State and Territory borders are present -- the rules are different between the jurisdictions and NSW.
- People should be aware of the risk of spreading the virus when handling gates or other equipment.

Above all, you should continue to monitor Federal, State and Territory
government sites to monitor changing rules and regulations. Stay safe
and protect yourselves and the community from the spread of this virus.
Should circumstances change, we will consider whether amendments to this
advice are required.

## About ACTHPA

The [ACT Hang gliding and Paragliding Association (ACTHPA)](info/about) is the club for all hang gliders, paragliders and their motorised forms in the region.
The region is excellent for carbon-free flying and there are some great areas for motorised flight as well.
We have [many excellent sites](info/sites), local paragliding instructors and an active pilot community.
We maintain a number of launch sites, and [wind talkers] in the local area to help in deciding when and where to fly.

## Flying in Canberra

If it is 'on' then you can pretty much guarantee that someone will be out flying.
If you are planning to go for a fly at [one of our sites](/flying-ACT/sites), please post a message on [our Facebook group] so you can meet up with others.
The [wind talkers] provide current wind speed and direction and records this information for the previous 12 hours.
The [weather resources page](info/weather-resources) links to useful weather information.

If you are a [visiting pilot](info), remember to contact one of the locals prior to flying any site.

## Learn to Fly

If you're interested in learning to fly, take a look at the [SAFA Schools page](https://www.safa.asn.au/training/flight-schools), and you could also join [our Facebook group] or come along to a club meeting to ask for recommendations.

## Club Meetings

Club meetings are held on the first Tuesday of each month (except December and January) at [the Canberra Labor Club](http://www.laborclub.com.au) in Weston Creek starting at 7.30 pm.
At the meetings we talk about flying and put members in contact with each other.
We have a strong social scene.

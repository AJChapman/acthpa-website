## Current COVID-19 Policy (updated 20 April 2020)

All of ACTHPA's sites are currently open, but please see the advice below.
We note the current NSW government restrictions on travel for essential purposes only and advise pilots to ensure their travel for exercise purposes complies with these NSW government restrictions.
 
We reiterate our previous hygiene and social distancing advice:

-  Fly at your closest currently flyable site.
-  It is strongly advised you carry hand sanitiser and/or wash your hands before and after opening and closing any gates or interacting with any fences.
-  When on site you must stay 2m away from any other pilots at all times.
-  Fly within the footprint of the site and only land in the designated landing zones for the site.
-  XC flying is not advised.
-  No car pooling or lifts up the hill.
-  Please do not drive another pilot’s car down the hill if possible.
-  If you require an SO or duty pilot to fly you can post a request for someone to contact you to arrange a site briefing and ok to fly.

Each pilot is individually responsible to ensure that they comply with all laws and regulations, including all aspects of the public health order related to having a reasonable excuse for leaving home.
You must not rely on this notice for that reasonable excuse.
Should pilots be queried about travel to and from these sites by police, please abide by the police directive and report your interaction to the ACTHPA committee so that information can be passed to members and ACTHPA guidance updated.

## About ACTHPA

The [ACT Hang gliding and Paragliding Association (ACTHPA)](info/about) is the club for all hang gliders, paragliders and their motorised forms in the region.
The region is excellent for carbon-free flying and there are some great areas for motorised flight as well.
We have [many excellent sites](info/sites), local paragliding instructors and an active pilot community.
We maintain a number of launch sites, and [wind talkers] in the local area to help in deciding when and where to fly.

## Flying in Canberra

If it is 'on' then you can pretty much guarantee that someone will be out flying.
If you are planning to go for a fly at [one of our sites](/flying-ACT/sites), please post a message on [our Facebook group] so you can meet up with others.
The [wind talkers] provide current wind speed and direction and records this information for the previous 12 hours.
The [weather resources page](info/weather-resources) links to useful weather information.

If you are a [visiting pilot](info), remember to contact one of the locals prior to flying any site.

If you're interested in learning to fly, take a look at the [SAFA Schools page](https://www.safa.asn.au/training/flight-schools), and you could also join [our Facebook group] or come along to a club meeting to ask for recommendations.

## Club Meetings

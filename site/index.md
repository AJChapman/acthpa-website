## Current COVID-19 Policy (updated 8 April 2020)

The ACTHPA Committee met by phone hookup this week to review the recent
decision to suspend flying at the sites we manage, after we sought
clarification from ACT Sport and Recreation regarding the status of hang
gliding and paragliding as sports that could be regarded as forms of
individual exercise.

We are pleased to inform you that advice has been received from the
Executive Branch Manager that hang gliding and paragliding fall outside
the current restrictions and may proceed. [The full statement is
here](/files/2020-04-06-ACT-Sport-Rec-Advice.pdf).
It is important that you read it in full.

This means that flying at ACT sites is lawful, although it is always
subject to change and it is our individual responsibility to monitor [the
ACT Government website (https://www.covid19.act.gov.au)](https://www.covid19.act.gov.au).
Access to
State and National Parks is a matter for the ACT Government and/or the
Federal Government and if there is a decision to close the parks our
flying sites will close. The site most commonly used in the ACT is
Lanyon.

Tandem Flight restrictions handed down from SAFA still apply in the ACT
as is does across Australia.

The situation is not yet resolved for ACTHPA managed sites in NSW. The
NSWHPA has likewise engaged with NSW Sport and Recreation. Any advice
they receive will be provided to members as soon as practicable. We have
provided them with a copy of the advice from the ACT.

So that is good news for those that are keen to continue flying.

When you read [the document from ACT Sport and Recreation](/files/2020-04-06-ACT-Sport-Rec-Advice.pdf) you will see
that it is no longer "business as usual". There are strict directives
that must be followed about the size of groups, physical distancing, use
of equipment, transport and the like.

The committee considered how to interpret these directives for our sport
and we list them as follows:

-   We are restricted to groups of two, so we recommend only one pilot
    on launch at any one time

-   If there are four pilots in the air already, please wait until
    someone has landed before launching

-   No car pooling

-   No cross country flights. Land only in the site designated LZ

-   Please use radios at the site and also carry a mobile phone and
    other safety devices you may regularly use

-   Please assess the conditions carefully to ensure they are within
    your capability. Safety is a critical factor at this time

-   Please be careful using padlocks and gates. The virus can live on
    hard surfaces for an extended time

-   Our strong preference is that you do not post your intentions or
    activities on the ACTHPA Facebook page (this could be seen as an invitation to a social
    gathering).

The most obvious directive is not specific to flying, ie physical
distancing, but it should be obvious that this is the most crucial
factor of all. It should be easy enough to maintain your four square
meters on the hill and indeed in the air.

Finally, we ask that you respect the decisions people make right now.
Some will choose not to fly. Others will be in the air as soon as
conditions allow and they will be flying lawfully, at least in the ACT.

As we stated above, the situation for ACTHPA managed sites in NSW is
under active review.

In fact all the committee's decisions need to constantly monitored and
reviewed as this is a rapidly changing situation and the laws may be
tightened or relaxed at any time.

As ever the committee is keen to promote the sport, to improve safety
and to protect and develop our sites. This also means maintaining close
working relationships with land owners and land holders.

Thank you all for your patience.

## About ACTHPA

The [ACT Hang gliding and Paragliding Association (ACTHPA)](info/about) is the club for all hang gliders, paragliders and their motorised forms in the region.
The region is excellent for carbon-free flying and there are some great areas for motorised flight as well.
We have [many excellent sites](info/sites), local paragliding instructors and an active pilot community.
We maintain a number of launch sites, and [wind talkers] in the local area to help in deciding when and where to fly.

## Flying in Canberra

If it is 'on' then you can pretty much guarantee that someone will be out flying.
If you are planning to go for a fly at [one of our sites](/flying-ACT/sites), please post a message on [our Facebook group] so you can meet up with others.
The [wind talkers] provide current wind speed and direction and records this information for the previous 12 hours.
The [weather resources page](info/weather-resources) links to useful weather information.

If you are a [visiting pilot](info), remember to contact one of the locals prior to flying any site.

## Learn to Fly

If you're interested in learning to fly, take a look at the [SAFA Schools page](https://www.safa.asn.au/training/flight-schools), and you could also join [our Facebook group] or come along to a club meeting to ask for recommendations.

## Club Meetings

Club meetings are held on the first Tuesday of each month (except December and January) at [the Canberra Labor Club](http://www.laborclub.com.au) in Weston Creek starting at 7.30 pm.
At the meetings we talk about flying and put members in contact with each other.
We have a strong social scene.

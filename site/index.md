The ACT Hang gliding and Paragliding Association (ACTHPA) is the club for all hang gliders, paragliders and their motorised forms in the region.
The region is excellent for carbon-free flying and there are some great areas for motorised flight as well.
We have many excellent sites, local paragliding instructors and an active pilot community.
We maintain a number of launch sites, and wind talkers in the local area to help in deciding when and where to fly.

Club meetings are held on the first Tuesday of each month (except December and January) at [the Canberra Labor Club](http://www.laborclub.com.au) in Weston Creek starting at 7.30 pm.
At the meetings we talk about flying and put members in contact with each other.
We have a strong social scene.

If it is 'on' then you can pretty much guarantee that someone will be out flying.
If you are planning to go for a fly at [one of our sites](/flying-ACT/sites), please post a message on [our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/260458037465074/) so you can meet up with others.
The [wind talkers](http://www.freeflightwx.com/acthpa/) provide current wind speed and direction and records this information for the previous 12 hours.
The weather section links to the Bureau of Meteorology and other useful weather information.

If you are a visiting pilot, remember to contact one of the locals prior to flying any site.

## [About ACTHPA](info/about)

The [ACT Hang gliding and Paragliding Association (ACTHPA)](info/about) is the club for all hang gliders, paragliders and their motorised forms in the region.
The region is excellent for carbon-free flying and there are some great areas for motorised flight as well.
We have [many excellent sites](info/sites), local paragliding instructors and an active pilot community.
We maintain a number of launch sites, and [wind talkers] in the local area to help in deciding when and where to fly.

## [Flying in Canberra](info)

If it is 'on' then you can pretty much guarantee that someone will be out flying.
If you are planning to go for a fly at [one of our sites](/flying-ACT/sites), please post a message on [our Telegram group] so you can meet up with others.
The [wind talkers] provide current wind speed and direction and records this information for the previous 12 hours.
The [weather resources page](info/weather-resources) links to useful weather information.

If you are a [visiting pilot](info), remember to contact one of the locals (best done through [our Telegram group]) prior to flying any site.

## Learn to Fly

If you're interested in learning to fly, take a look at the [SAFA Schools page](https://www.safa.asn.au/training/flight-schools), and you could also join [our Facebook group] or come along to a club meeting to ask for recommendations.

## Club Meetings

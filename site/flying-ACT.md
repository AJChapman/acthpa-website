## TODO: Advice for Pilots

Some general advice for pilots in the region.
The sort of thing you would eventually learn through talking to others at a meeting.

### TODO: Flying Safely

- Understand the weather,
- Talk to local pilots,
- (PG) Don't fly a wing that is too advanced for your skill and experience level,
- (PG) Do SIV training,
- (PG) When ridge soaring, test your penetration.
- (PG) When ridge soaring, don't fly too close to the hill.

### TODO: Weather Hazards

- Look out for the sea breeze,

### TODO: Comms

- Post on and check Facebook,
- Use channel HGFA 1 (frequency xxx, tone squelch yyy),
- Track some XC pilots of highcloud.net (link).

### TODO: Flying the Lake

- Look at the wind talker,
- Hang gliders fly the sea breeze at the lake in the evening,
- Paragliders fly the sea breeze at the lake early the next morning,
- Collector is generally for XC,
- Geary's Gap is a good place to learn to top land, but don't learn in strong winds.

### TODO: Flying XC

- XC from Spring Hill is hard because of airspace, but possible,
- Our best XC site is Collector, though it only works in a light prevailing easterly, and airspace is still a concern. 
- Honeysuckle and Binalong are possible XC sites if you are willing to travel further,

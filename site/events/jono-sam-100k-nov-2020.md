It started on Friday evening, with Jonathan 'Jono' Bishop sending out a text message: "I'm charging my batteries... hoping for some collector action^[This refers to the [Collector launch](/info/sites#collector)] tomorrow."
Jono is an active Canberra paraglider pilot, whom you may know [from this wildlife encounter last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y-JM6r85O8).
Most flying days he can be found hiking up the hills to the south of Canberra, with a glider on his back, to launch and share the sky with the local wedge-tailed eagles.
But on this day he ventured north of Canberra, to the ridge overlooking Lake George.
This is where he, Sam Rybak, and several other XC^[XC is an abbreviation of Cross-Country.] hopefuls agreed to meet, with a tentative plan to try to fly 50km to Bowning Hill.

By the end of the day, [Sam had flown 113km](https://www.xcontest.org/world/en/flights/detail:srybak/7.11.2020/01:40)^[These distances are measured via three turnpoints, a common way of measuring which allows some course deviation but doesn't give you extra distance for every twist and turn that you take.], and [Jono a little further at 116km](https://www.xcontest.org/world/en/flights/detail:JonathanBishop/7.11.2020/01:35#fd=flight).
You can [replay their tracklogs on Ayvri](https://ayvri.com/scene/49j7o88dke/ckh7k586d00023r6bg5kjnfwj).

An unusual aspect of this flight was that they were able to fly together the whole way.
It takes some effort to coordinate, and discipline to stay together for so long, but there are advantages too, such as being able to spread out when searching for lift.
Here's Jono:

> It was good fun having someone to fly XC with.
> I think we worked well together, but I spent most of the time trying to keep up with Sam.

For Sam the flight would be a PB -- the first time he's flown over 100km.
Jono achieved [a similar feat last year, when  he flew 121km from the same site](https://www.xcontest.org/2020/world/en/flights/detail:JonathanBishop/8.12.2019/00:11).
Sam watched Jono launch first, playing the role of wind dummy^[A wind dummy, or wind technician, is someone who launches first, searching for thermals when there aren't yet any obvious signs of them, such as other gliders or birds climbing].
Collector is a [notoriously tricky site to get up at](/advice/collector-xc-tips), so there was a very real chance of bombing out^[Bombing out is landing without finding a thermal, a very disappointing outcome.], as several pilots did that day.
Jono made a couple of passes along the ridge, slowly losing height.
Getting quite low, he managed to find some weak lift in the gully north of launch and, turning figure-eights in it so as not to fly towards the hill, he slowly rose above launch height.
Sam saw him climbing and launched to join him.

Eventually their climb consolidated and they took it to 1,600m AMSL^[AMSL stands for Above Mean Sea Level] as it drifted over the forest behind launch.
Now they were committed, and started gliding downwind, to the north-west.
The next four hours were just your regular XC fare, which is to say that it was no doubt full of spectacular views, alternating moments of awe and excitement, and continuous concentration as they worked to stay above the ground but below airspace, and make forward progress.
As they worked their way north-west the airspace stepped up, and they were able to take advantage of the rising cloud base as the day progressed to climb to 2,200m AMSL (1.6km above the ground) as they passed over Boorowa.
Eventually the day ran out of thermals, and they landed just after 5pm.

Alex Boiko, after bombing out himself, decided to retrieve drive:

> Even though they ended up near good roads, they flew over some wild country.
> I was as close as possible (probably should have had a 4wd, not the outback on the roads that weren't on google!) but there was a low save where they might have had 10+km of walking.
> Without phone signal for either them or me.

Alex caught up with them soon after they landed, providing celebratory beers and of course a lift home.
Kudos, Alex!

Along the way they had a low save^[A low save is when you find a climb just in the nick of time, right above the ground.] with some added excitement.
Here's Jono:

> Got down to 200m AGL^[AGL stands for Above Ground Level] about 50km into the flight and both thought it was game over, but we got away again.
> Just as we got away Alex Boiko randomly spotted us from a road below and we could see him chasing us.
> We were getting pretty low over some dodgy looking farms, the kind with car wrecks and rubbish all over the place and heard some gun shots.
> We thought someone was shooting at us, so we found a thermal and got the hell out of there.

Communication wasn't by radio, it would seem?

> Had one moment at cloud base^[Cloud base is literally at the base of a cloud. A wonderful place to be.] where we were both yelling at each other trying to decide which way to go.

And another low save:

> Sam got so low over Boorowa, all the dogs were barking at him, then we both jagged a nice thermal to cloud base.
> I got cocky and decided to spear off and tag the Boorowa racecourse turnpoint^[This refers to a turnpoint in the [ACTHPA Turnpoint Challenge](https://www.turnpointchallenge.com.au/challenge-acthpa2020?chl=8)], lost a heap of hight and still missed the turnpoint by 300m!
> Was good fun.
> Smooth thermals, but hard work and slow going to start with.

Congratulations guys, it looks like there could be a good XC season ahead of us.

It started on Friday evening, with Jono sending out a text message: "I'm charging my batteries... hoping for some collector action tomorrow."
Saturday's forecast was for an easterly breeze, and an atmospheric lapse rate showing the potential for decent thermic activity.
That 'Collector action' refers to flying from the [/info/sites#collector](Collector) launch, which overlooks Lake George.
<!-- TODO: quote from Jono about the forecast? -->
Jonathan Bishop is an active Canberra paraglider pilot, whom you may know [from this wildlife encounter last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y-JM6r85O8).
Most flying days he can be found hiking up the hills to the south of Canberra, with a glider on his back, launching to share the sky with the local wedge-tailed eagles.
<!-- TODO: quote from Jono about wedgies or hike-and-fly? -->
But on this day he ventured further north, to the ridge overlooking Lake George, where he, Sam, and several other cross-country (XC) hopefuls had agreed to meet, with a tentative plan to try to fly 50km to Bowning Hill.
By the end of the day, [Sam had flown 113km](https://www.xcontest.org/world/en/flights/detail:srybak/7.11.2020/01:40), and [Jono a little further at 116km](https://www.xcontest.org/world/en/flights/detail:JonathanBishop/7.11.2020/01:35#fd=flight).
[You can replay their tracklogs on Ayvri here](https://ayvri.com/scene/49j7o88dke/ckh7k586d00023r6bg5kjnfwj).

For Sam the flight would be a PB -- the first time he's flown over 100km.
Jono achieved [a similar feat last year, when  he flew 121km from the same site](https://www.xcontest.org/2020/world/en/flights/detail:JonathanBishop/8.12.2019/00:11).
Sam watched Jono launch first, playing the role of 'wind dummy' (or 'wind technician'), searching for thermals without obvious signs of them, such as other gliders or birds climbing.
Collector is a [notoriously tricky site to get up at](/advice/collector-xc-tips), so there was a very real chance of 'bombing out' (landing without finding a thermal), as several pilots did that day.
Jono launched and made a couple of passes along the ridge, slowly losing height.
Getting quite low, he managed to find some weak lift in the gully north of launch and, turning figure-eights in it so as not to fly towards the hill, he slowly rose above launch height.
Sam saw him climbing and launched to join him.

Eventually their climb consolidated and they took it to 1,600 metres above mean sea level (AMSL) as it drifted over the forest behind launch.
Now they were committed, and started gliding downwind, to the north-west.
The next four hours were just your regular XC fare, which is to say that it was no doubt full of spectacular views, alternating moments of awe and terror, and continuous concentration as they worked to stay above the ground but below airspace, and make forward progress.
As they worked their way north-west the airspace stepped up, and they were able to take advantage of the rising cloudbase as the day progressed to climb to 2,200m AMSL (1.6km above the ground) as they passed over Boorowa.
Eventually the day ran out of thermals, and they landed just after 5pm.

<!-- Quotes:

Alex Boiko: "Even though they ended up near good roads, they flew over some wild country. I was as close as possible (probably should have had a 4wd, not the outback on the roads that weren't on google!) but there was a low save where they might have had 10+km of walking. Without phone signal for either them or me."

Jono: "Thanks Alex. I only snapped the one photo at cloud base unfortunately. We could stage an after photo... drinking a beer in a random paddock somewhere. Any excuse for a beer. Happy to answer questions. It was good fun having someone to fly XC with. I think we worked well together, but I spent most of the time trying to keep up with Sam. There were a few funny moments. Got down to 200m agl about 50km into the flight and both thought it was game over, but we got away again. Just as we got away Alex Boiko randomly spotted us from a road below and we could see him chasing us. We were getting pretty low over some dodgy looking farms, the kind with car wrecks and rubish all over the place and heard some gun shots. We though someone was shooting at us, so we found a thermal and got the hell out of there. Had one moment at cloud base where we were both yelling at each other trying to decide which way to go. Sam got so low over Boorowa, all the dogs were barking at him, then we both jagged a nice themal to cloud base. I got cocky and decided to spear off and tag the Boorowa racecourse turnpoint, lost a heap of hight and still missed the turnpoint by 300m! Was good fun. Smooth thermals, but hard work and slow going to start with."

<!-- Questions:

Both:
- How do you feel about the flight?
- How many others were flying? How did they go?
- What was the plan for the day?
- How did you choose your route? 
- Was it hard to stick together in the air? How did you do it?
- Were you in radio contact the whole time?
- I notice you both took short detours to the north-east near Gunning and Dalton. What were they about?
- What were the highlights?
- Were there any nervous moments during the flight?
- How was the journey home?

Jono:
- What was it about the forecast that made you think it would be a good day?
- How long have you been flying? And how many hours?
- You seem to do a lot of hike-and-fly. How does that compare with this style of flying?
- What wing, harness, and gear were you flying with?
- I notice you *almost* tagged the Boorowa turnpoint. What happened there?

Sam:
- Is this a PB? What was your previous best?
- How long have you been flying? And how many hours?
- Did it help to fly with Jono?
- What wing, harness, and gear were you flying with?
- I heard you only landed because you were busting. Will you be taking an XC-pee next time? (I can leave this out if it's too embarrassing)

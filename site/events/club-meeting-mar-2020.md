Join us at our next club meeting on Tuesday 4 February at 7:30pm at the [Weston Creek Labor Club](https://goo.gl/maps/6EtdRPvfNiqLgX2U7).

After our regular meeting, Phil Lyng will introduce 'The Life Cycle of a Paraglider Pilot', which mentions all the stages we go through, from P2 to P5, and attaining formal certificates like VHF endorsement, Oxygen, towing, and then other informal things like SIV, hike-and-fly, vol biv, FAI badges, etc.
This introduction will lay the foundation for future talks on individual subjects.
We'll also hear from Alex Chapman and others who went to the recent competitions in [Bright] and [Corryong].

Club meetings are held on the first Tuesday of every month except December (which is our Christmas party instead) and January.

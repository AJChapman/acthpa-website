Dear Canberra Pilots

The ACTHPA Committee is concerned about the way we currently use (or
don't use) radios at our sites. There have been a number of situations
where pilots supervising PG2s have not been able to get in touch with
the PG2s to alert them of changing conditions or potentially unsafe
flying. There has also been some confusion by visiting pilots about the
frequency that we use for general communication in the air.

## Proposal

To address these concerns, the committee proposes to:

- Require PG2s who are being supervised by a qualified pilot at any
  ACTHPA site to carry a UHF radio that can receive transmissions on
  "HGFA 1" so if conditions change the PG2 pilot can be advised and
  directed by the supervising pilot;

- Strongly suggest the use of radios by all pilots at ACTHPA sites
  when multiple pilots are soaring (you still don't have to carry it
  up when you do a solo morning sleddie at Lanyon); and

- Ask that pilots use "HGFA 1" instead of "Open" at ACTHPA sites.

## Reasons

[PG2 Radio Contact:]{.ul} We consider that supervision does not end when
the PG2's feet leave the ground. It would often be helpful for the PG2s
and their supervisors to be able to respond to changing conditions or
flying patterns. Encouraging PG2s to get into the radio habit will also
help foster a culture of using radios -- this will help general
communication at our sites and wider use of radios could assist in
managing emergency situations.

[HGFA 1:]{.ul} Using "Open" creates confusion for visitors, particularly
because we can hear them but they cannot hear our replies. Having HGFA 1
as our main frequency still leaves the three others as private channels
for pilot use if HGFA 1 becomes too busy (it rarely does in Canberra).

## Timing & Consultation

The committee hopes to make these effective from [1 February 2021]{.ul},
but in the meantime would welcome any comments and suggestions, which we
will consider in good faith. We are particularly interested in hearing
from PG2s and supervising Pilots. However since radio use affects
everyone, we encourage all Canberra pilots (all HG, PG and PPG ratings)
to let us know their views.

You can comment on the Facebook post or email <office@acthpa.org>. If
you would like your comments to be anonymised (they will not be
attributed to you, but may be discussed generally) or confidential (they
will not be shared beyond the committee other than in very high level
terms) please send them by email and note this at the top of your email.

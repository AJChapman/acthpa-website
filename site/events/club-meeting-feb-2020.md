Our last club meeting was on Tuesday 4 February at 7:30pm at the [Weston Creek Labor Club](https://goo.gl/maps/6EtdRPvfNiqLgX2U7).
The topic [presented by Phil Lyng was airspace, and how we go about flying in and around it](/advice/a-few-things-about-AIRSPACE).

Club meetings are held on the first Tuesday of every month except December (which is our Christmas party instead) and January.

Join us at our next club meeting on Tuesday 4 February at 7:30pm at the [Weston Creek Labor Club](https://goo.gl/maps/6EtdRPvfNiqLgX2U7).
Our topic this month will be airspace, and how we go about flying in and around it.

Club meetings are held on the first Tuesday of every month except December (which is our Christmas party instead) and January.

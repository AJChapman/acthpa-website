Kari flew a very tactical race, with the help of the rest of the Australian team, to edge out Marcella Uchoa by only 19 points.
This was Kari's second World Championships, having [secured second place in the 2017 event in Monte Avena, Italy](https://airtribune.com/worlds2017/results/task2702/comp/women).

During the event Kari kept her Facebook followers in the loop with a write-up of each task, which she has kindly allowed us to [post here as well](/stories/kari-worlds-2019).

## Presentation of Annual Report

with Allister Higgins reported on the Association's current financial
position.

## Committee Elections
Michael Porter deputized for the Public Officer and conducted elections for the committee for the coming year, resulting in the following appointments

President: Rene Sedlmaier

Vice President: Graham Rose

Treasurer: Allister Higgins

Secretary: Wes Kilham

General Members: Alex Chapman and Phil Lyng

Site Development Officer: Doug Mathie

Peter (Chop) Lamont will remain as Public Officer and Alistair Dickie
will re-nominate as the ACT and district representative on the SAFA
Board.

Allister Higgins, Doug Mathie and Alistair Dickie gave brief
descriptions of their areas of responsibility.

Allister indicated there are currently 91 paid up members of ACTHPA. It
is anticipated there may be more actual members, meaning some pilots may
not have paid their SAFA membership fees. This excludes them from flying
at ACTHPA sites and from insurance cover.

Anyone who is late paying their fees is urged to act immediately.

Rene Sedlmaier resumed the chair following the election of the committee
and welcomed three visitors to the Association, all of whom are hoping
to become licensed pilots in the near future.

## Awards

Only one award was made, the Eagle Award to Johnathan Bishop for a flight from Collector to Binalong.

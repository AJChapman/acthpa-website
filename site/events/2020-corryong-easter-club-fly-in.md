Following on from the success of last year's event, we are organising a club fly-in with the Skyhigh paragliding club in Corryong over Easter.
It will be a great weekend to do your first XC or maybe your longest.
All skill levels are welcome, from PG2 to PG5.
This for all our ACT club members, including HG, PG and Powered.

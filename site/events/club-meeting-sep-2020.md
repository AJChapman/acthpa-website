After a long hiatus our [next club meeting](/events/club-meeting-sep-2020) will be held in a new, COVID-safe format at [Spring Hill](https://siteguide.org.au/Sites/Spring%20Hill.html), where we will meet outdoors, have a BBQ, then do some flying or ground handling, or other activity, weather-dependent.

We'll be starting at 10am.
Bring your own camp chair and shade.

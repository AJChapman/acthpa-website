We held our first club meeting since the start of the pandemic at [Spring Hill](https://siteguide.org.au/Sites/Spring%20Hill.html) on Saturday September 5.
The meeting was to start at 10am, but it was flyable, so what are you going to do?
So we flew, and had the meeting when the wind got too strong for paragliders (the hang gliders were just starting to get into their element).

We will be holding our annual general meeting at [Spring Hill](https://siteguide.org.au/Sites/Spring%20Hill.html) on Saturday October 3rd.
It may be flyable so bring your wing.
The start time can be flexible depending on the weather, but at this stage we are expecting it to blow out before 10am.

Current members running for the committee membership are:

- Wes Kilham,
- Doug Mathie,
- Alex Chapman,
- Phil Lyng, and
- Rene Sedlmaier.

We need another two for the main committee but are also asking for four members as site managers/coordinators.

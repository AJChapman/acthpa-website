## About the Corryong PG Open

The Corryong PG Open takes place every year, attracting some of the best pilots in the country, and a few from around the world.
Corryong is only 3 1/2 to 4 hours' drive from Canberra.
It is a small town in a huge valley surrounded by hills and bordering the Snowy Mountains.
It's an amazing place to fly -- easily one of the best in Australia.
Mt. Elliot overlooks the town and offers plenty of height and plenty of thermals, and its easy launch and landing make it suitable for beginners as well.
The only limitation is a requirement for a VHF endorsement to fly within the Corryong CTAF.

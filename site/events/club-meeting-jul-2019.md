## Items from the ACTHPA Committee Meeting

Purchase of porosity tester: Under active consideration. Al Dickie
suggested equipment of this kind be donated to a club member for safe
keeping and maintenance.

Club Challenge: Commencing. Talk to Rene to add your name as a
participant

Site Issues: Phil Robinson wanting to continue improvements to Spring
Hill launch. Truck driver required. Anthony Willing indicated he has a
truck license

Club Shirt: Also under active consideration. Rene proposes a long sleeve
shirt with thumb holes, with an image rather than the club logo. Plan is
it should be cost neutral.

SO Training: Kari Ellis and Johnno Bishop have organized to do safety
officer training with Al Dickie.

HG proposal for a dolly: HG pilots are investigating further.

## Club Meeting minutes
Proposed they be "sanitized" and put on FB.

## Use of Radios
Club members urged to carry radios and use them at
our sites. Not a mandatory requirement, but strongly encouraged.

## Election of new Committee Member
Rene proposed that the club add a
new committee member to be known as the Site Development Officer. Doug
Mathie nominated and duly elected by a show of hands.

## Club fees
Al Dickie indicated that club fees have been reduced from
\$55 to \$50 in line with NSW. Early renewal of SAFA membership is from
15 July to 15 August. This brings with it a \$15 saving. A further \$15
can be discounted if a member elects to receive SkySailor in electronic
form.

## Awards

### Eagle Award

Eagle went to Phil Lyng who flew from Tolmin in Slovenia to the Italian
border and return. Phil also had a flight to 4000 metres in Austria.

### Novice Award

Novice award went to Alex Boiko who flew for 4 hours and 13 minutes in
one flight at Spring Hill

### FARK Award

FARK went to Wes Kilham for landing in the venture at Spring and
becoming tangled in thistles. Thanks to Phil Robinson for assisting with
the thistle removal.

Other contender was Alex Chapman who draped his wing in a small tree
while top landing at Lake George and who was dragged twice at his home
while ground handling, both times contacting a fence.

Lessons: Don't try landing in the venturi when the wind is still strong
and always retain situational awareness.

## Hike and Fly Discussion

Good discussion on potential hike and fly sites around Canberra,
especially in the Brindabellas. Some exploratory work has been done and
contact made with ACT Parks.

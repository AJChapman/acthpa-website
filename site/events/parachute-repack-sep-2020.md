The parachute repack night was held on Friday September 4 at Mount Stromlo High School.

The event was run by Stephen York and Rafael Esquillaro, both very experienced riggers.
Stephen also provided 'party bags' packed with the essentials for parachute repacking: rubber bands, string, and lollies.
Phil Lyng organised the night, which went very smoothly at a great venue.

If you missed the night, or you want your chute professionally repacked Stephen will do this for you for a cost of $80.
We may also run another repack night in the near future if there is enough interest.

The parachute repack night is on Friday September 4 commencing at 6pm at Mount Stromlo High School.
[Register your interest here](https://tinyurl.com/yxe78955).

The event will be run by Stephen York and Rafael Esquillaro, both very experienced riggers.
Phil Lyng has done all the organisation for the night and he too has very useful skills.

If you want your chute professionally repacked Stephen will do this for you for a cost of $80, but obviously not on the night in question.

It might be an opportunity to bring your wing as well and if time allows we can do wing checks.

The repack night is at no cost to members.

The first 20 people to register will be accepted and others will be placed on a waiting list for a second night.

We do need a Covid-19 plan to use the hall and we will publish details.
Obviously they relate to social distancing and hygiene and leaving the hall and facilities clean.
Please bring hand sanitiser if you have some.

The [Bright Open](https://airtribune.com/bright-open-2021/info) was held in early February.
There were seven ACTHPA pilots who took part in this year's Bright Open, out of a field of 53 competitors:

- Kari Ellis,
- Alistair Dickie,
- Phil Robinson,
- Alex Chapman,
- Alex Boiko,
- Daniel Thuillier and
- Johno Quinn.

Astute readers will notice the absence of Graham Rose, who put himself out of the running by crashing his mountain bike on Mystic.
Stick to a safer sport Grum -- like paragliding!

Alistair also sponsored the competition, giving away a stack of BlueFly varios for good sportsmanship or personal achievements.

## About the Bright Open

Bright is a beautiful mountain town in Victoria, about five hours' drive from Canberra.
It is a regular flying destination for Canberra pilots, but is also a favourite for Melbourne pilots, interationals, and has a thriving local scene including several instructors.

From the Bright open website:

> Bright Open 2021 is a one of three legs of the Australian Nationals (SAFA) AAA sanctioned competition of the 2020-21 season.
> The Open will consist of one round which will count towards a pilot's WPRS score.
> All tasks over the 8 days will contribute to the AAA Sanction / Aussie ladder / Team Selection Ladder.
> Being AAA rated, this will see 450 points available for the Aussie ladder, however, if Covid - 19 restrictions mean that some pilots cannot travel interstate then the event might be downgraded.

Note that the open has since been downgraded to a B sanctioned event.

After the Bright Open, many of the pilots will move on to the [Corryong PG Open](../corryong-2021).

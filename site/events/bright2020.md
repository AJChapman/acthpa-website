It looks like it was a tough day to stay in the air, with only 34 out of 81 pilots completing the course.

The Canberra pilots' results were:

- Kari Ellis in 6th place in a time of 1:10:10,
- Johno Quinn in 20th, in a time of 1:26:42,

Peter Slade won [this 93.95km task](http://xc.highcloud.net/task_result.html?comPk=281&tasPk=1256) in a time of 2:32:43.
It was an even tougher course set by the task committee, with only 27 pilots making end-of-speed.
Judging by the results it looks as if the Australian national team were flying as a team, with Gareth Carter, Kari Ellis and Felipe Rezende finishing less than a minute behind Peter Slade.

The Canberra pilots' results were:

- Kari Ellis in equal 3rd in a time of 2:33:29, now in 2nd overall,

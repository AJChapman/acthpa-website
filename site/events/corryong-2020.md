The [Corryong Paragliding Open](https://airtribune.com/flow-corryong-pg-open-2020/info) is on now, with five Canberra pilots competing: Kari Ellis, Johno Quinn, Alistair Dickie, Phil Robinson, and Alex Chapman.

## Results

AirScore has the most up-to date [overall results](http://xc.highcloud.net/comp_overall.html?comPk=287), and [task results](http://xc.highcloud.net/task_overview.html?comPk=287).
During a task you can watch pilots' progress semi-live on [HighCloud's Spot page for the Corryong region](http://highcloud.net/spot/region.html?lat=-36.2&lon=147.8&zoom=11).

### Task 1

[Task 1 was a 44.07km race](http://xc.highcloud.net/task_result.html?comPk=287&tasPk=1260) down the Thowgla valley, across to Colac Colac, back to Mt. Elliot, then over the back to Khancoban.
It was won by Gareth Carter in a time of 1:12:05, after Kari Ellis landed just a few metres short of goal in a time of 1:11:56.
There was some controversy at the start of the race, with wind over the back on launch meaning that only 35 of the 73 pilots were in the air when the task started.
A protest was filed but turned down by the protest committee.
All pilots did eventually manage to get in the air, and 50 pilots made it to goal.

The Canberra pilots' results were:

- Johno Quinn in 36th in a time of 1:43:22,
- Kari Ellis in 43rd,
- Alistair Dickie in 50th in a time of 2:26:01,
- Phil Robinson in 59th, at 32.7km when the task was called off due to developing rain and thunderstorms. Phil was at 1736m AMSL when the task was called off,
- Alex Chapman in 62nd, at 29.35km.

### Task 2

[Task 2 was a 55.3km race](http://xc.highcloud.net/task_result.html?comPk=287&tasPk=1264) from Towong to Cudgewa, across to Chinaman's Hat, back to near Cudgewa, then back up the valley to the Mt. Elliot LZ.
It was again won by Gareth Carter, who was the only pilot to make goal, just before the race deadline.
The 5pm deadline was a factor because the start had been delayed by changing weather conditions around midday, and by the tasks committee's decision to set a late start time to ensure that everyone got off the hill before the start.

</div>

Most pilots opted to launch early today, before or during the open window.
This meant that there was again a long queue on launch, which would be a topic of intense discussion on the following day.
But the launch delays were less, and soon most pilots were in the air with plenty of time before the race start.
Most spent this time either high over Mt. Elliot, or struggling in weak lift near the start cylinder.

</div>

The race started at 2:45pm, with most opting to make the shortened valley crossing to Mittamatite before heading along its ridgeline towards Cudgewa.
A couple of pilots went straight down the valley, making slower progress but not losing too much ground because their route was more direct.
Some opted to cross to Mittamatite further along the valley, with much less luck.
The day had big clouds, but also big blue holes and extensive shade cast by the clouds.
The clouds made for strong climbs, but between them the sink, rarely punctuated by weak thermals, meant that there was a stead attrition rate throughout the race.

The Canberra pilots' results were:

- Kari Ellis in 3rd, at 51.47km with 76.9 lead-out kms, currently in 21st place overall,
- Johno Quinn in 23rd, at 41.03km, currently in 31st place overall,
- Alistair Dickie in 26th, at 40.17km, narrowly missing out on 1st place in Fun class, currently in 39th place overall, and 2nd place in Fun class,
- Alex Chapman in 46th, at 26.09km, currently in 59th place overall, and
- Phil Robinson in 52nd, at 16.37km, currently in 62nd place overall. 

## About the Corryong PG Open

The Corryong PG Open takes place every year, attracting some of the best pilots in the country, and a few from around the world.
Corryong is only 3 1/2 to 4 hours' drive from Canberra.
It is a small town in a huge valley surrounded by hills and bordering the Snowy Mountains.
It's an amazing place to fly -- easily one of the best in Australia.
Mt. Elliot overlooks the town and offers plenty of height and plenty of thermals, and its easy launch and landing make it suitable for beginners as well.
The only limitation is a requirement for a VHF endorsement to fly within the Corryong CTAF.

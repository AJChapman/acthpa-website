For five days in early February the sky around the mountain town of Bright in country Victoria was filled with 80 paraglider pilots competing in the annual [Bright Open](https://airtribune.com/bright-open-2022/info).
This is a cross-country competition in which pilots race around a course which is chosen on the day to suit the weather conditions.
This year [the tasks ranged in distance from 70km to 97km](http://xc.highcloud.net/task_overview.html?comPk=317).

If you want some sense of what the racing was like, check out the Ayvri 'Horse Races' that Wally Arcidiacono puts together from everyone's tracklogs:

- [Task 1](https://ayvri.com/scene/eyj8rde15g/ckz9n6efi0026386mkinz5hwp)
- [Task 2](https://ayvri.com/scene/eyj8rde15g/ckzb3oyl70025386mb20po55z)
- [Task 3](https://ayvri.com/scene/eyj8rde15g/ckzcjbq810025386m65aamkiz)
- [Task 4](https://ayvri.com/scene/eyj8rde15g/ckze0vw1m0027386mwk78xzri)
- [Task 5](https://ayvri.com/scene/eyj8rde15g/ckziwq1ai00233c6qrcvpvjs1)

Here are some tips for watching the horse races on Ayvri:

- Check out the course first on [airScore](http://xc.highcloud.net/task_overview.html?comPk=317&tasPk=1465),
- Select an interesting pilot to watch (e.g. the winner of the task),
- Make it fullscreen (square icon bottom right),
- Turn off tracks so you can see what's going on (third icon from bottom right, then click the squiggle),
- Slow it down to at least 32x real time (minus icon bottom left),
- Expand the stats so you can see the pilot's altitude and climb rate (middle right), (for reference the altitude of the valley floor is usually around 300m),
- Zoom in and out by scrolling, click and drag to move the view around,
- The race doesn't begin right at the start, the pilots first gather for the start which happens at a prearranged time, so watch for when everyone starts going fast in the same direction.

A particular highlight this year was Task 5, which was a 97km triangle, finishing up close to where we started.
Amazingly, [one and only one pilot, Brett Robinson, got to goal](http://xc.highcloud.net/task_result.html?comPk=317&tasPk=1465), and he was flying an EN-C glider (sports class, not a high-performance competition wing).

The overall results can be seen on [airScore](http://xc.highcloud.net/comp_overall.html?comPk=317).
